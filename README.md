# Handwritten Digit Recognition Multiclass

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using a multiclass classification approach. The model is trained and evaluated using TensorFlow and Keras on the popular MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a common problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) by learning from a large dataset of labeled examples.
